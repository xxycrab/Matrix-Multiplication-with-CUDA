		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #2

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Xinyu Xie(A53285829)

 
B: Jiawen Fang

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	8              8
coding 	  	  	        16             16
writeup 	  	  	8              8
planning (alone) 	  	  	       4
total (including meetings) 	  	       36 


(3) Describe 
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
      We almost share every part of the work. Generally, we take turns to implement an idea and debug for each other.
  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
      Yes!
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
      The strengths of our team is good communication and frequent discussion.
      The weakness lies in the fact that we are not familiar with each other at first, but we soon get along well.
  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
       Even though it is a short program, we need to spend much time to optimize the code.There are so many factors
       influencing program's performance and we need to pay more attention to this in the future.
  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
      We like the way we work together.
  (f) anything else that comes to mind.
      We learned a lot in this work, but maybe next time a more conflict assignment can be more helpful.
